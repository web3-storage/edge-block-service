# edge-block-service

> A block service in the edge to store IPFS data structures

## Getting started

One time set up of your cloudflare worker subdomain for dev:

- `npm install` - Install the project dependencies from the monorepo root directory
- Sign up to Cloudflare and log in with your default browser.
- `npm i @cloudflare/wrangler -g` - Install the Cloudflare wrangler CLI
- `wrangler login` - Authenticate your wrangler cli; it'll open your browser.
- Copy your cloudflare account id from `wrangler whoami`
- Update `wrangler.toml` with a new `env`. Set your env name to be the value of `whoami` on your system you can use `pnpm start` to run the worker in dev mode for you.

  [**wrangler.toml**](./wrangler.toml)

  ```toml
  [env.bobbytables]
  workers_dev = true
  account_id = "<what does the `wrangler whoami` say>"
  ```

- Add secrets

  ```sh
    wrangler secret put SENTRY_DSN --env $(whoami) # Get from Sentry (not required for dev)
    wrangler secret put LOGTAIL_TOKEN --env $(whoami) # Get from Logtail
  ```

- Add R2 bucket (Note that it is only available as Private Beta at the time of writing)

  ```sh
  wrangler r2 bucket create blockstore --env $(whoami)
  # ðŸŒ€  Creating bucket "blockstore"
  # âœ¨  Success!
  ```

- `npm run publish` - Publish the worker under your env. An alias for `wrangler publish --env $(whoami)`
- `npm dev` - Run the worker in dev mode. An alias for `wrangler dev --env $(whoami)`

You only need to `npm dev` for subsequent runs. PR your env config to the `wrangler.toml` to celebrate ðŸŽ‰

## Usage

You can see full HTTP API specification at https://web3.storage/block-service-docs.

### ðŸ”’ `PUT /`

> Store individuals blocks by multihash in R2.

TODO: curl example

### ðŸ”’ `GET /:multihash`

> Multihash block read interface.

The block data is retrieved and discovered by multihash, in order to enable the same data to be referred to with different codecs.

TODO: curl example

### ðŸ”’ `PUT /car`

> Store CAR files by writing the blocks to block storage and writing the CAR header and a CARv2 index of the blocks in R2

TODO: curl example

### ðŸ”’ `GET /car:cid`

> CAR read interface.
